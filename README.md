Problem Statement

The current market for informal labor is inefficient and disconnected. Currently, finding a skilled professional—like a plumber, electrician, or carpenter—relies almost entirely on word of mouth.

This "word of mouth" system is flawed:

For Workers: Many talented professionals remain unemployed simply because they are not part of a specific social circle. They lack a platform to showcase their availability to the wider public.

For Employers: Hiring becomes a game of luck. Relying on personal referrals is slow, and there is no way to verify if a worker is actually available or nearby when an emergency strikes.

💡 The Solution

LabourConnect digitizes this process, moving beyond the limitations of personal networks to create a transparent, instant, and reliable marketplace for everyone.

LabourConnect provides a live, interactive map where workers can "go active" to show they are ready for hire. Employers can instantly see who is nearby, filter by specific skills, and contact them immediately. This replaces slow "word of mouth" searches with a 2-second map scan.

✨ Key Features

1.Interactive Map: Built with Leaflet.js, providing a lightweight and fast map experience to see workers' locations in real-time.

2.Gemini Voice Assistant: Powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash, the app features a voice interface. Users can interact with the platform using natural language, making it accessible for users who prefer speaking over typing.

3.Live Availability Status: A simple system where workers can mark themselves as available or busy, updating the map instantly.

4.One-Touch Communication: A direct "Call" feature that bridges the gap between seeing a worker on the map and hiring them for a job.

5.Firebase Backend: All worker data and locations are synced in real-time using Firestore.

6.Easy and Understandle User interference.
