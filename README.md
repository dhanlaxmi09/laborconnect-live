🤔Problem Statement

The current market for informal labor is inefficient and disconnected. Currently, finding a skilled professional—like a plumber, electrician, or carpenter—relies almost entirely on word of mouth.

This "word of mouth" system is flawed:

For Workers: Many talented professionals remain unemployed simply because they are not part of a specific social circle. They lack a platform to showcase their availability to the wider public.

For Employers: Hiring becomes a game of luck. Relying on personal referrals is slow, and there is no way to verify if a worker is actually available or nearby when an emergency strikes.

💡 The Solution

LabourConnect digitizes this process, moving beyond the limitations of personal networks to create a transparent, instant, and reliable marketplace for everyone.

LabourConnect provides a live, interactive map where workers can "go active" to show they are ready for hire. Employers can instantly see who is nearby, filter by specific skills, and contact them immediately. This replaces slow "word of mouth" searches with a 2-second map scan.
LabourConnect is a real-time app that makes finding workers as easy as ordering a pizza. It takes the old, slow way of finding help and makes it instant using a map.

How we solve the problem:
From "Word of Mouth" to "Real-Time Map": Instead of waiting for a friend to give you a phone number, you just open the app. You can see a live map of workers near you who are ready to work right now.

Live Availability: Workers can turn their status ON (Available) or OFF (Busy). This means employers only call people who are actually free, saving everyone’s time.

Smart Voice Assistant: We used Gemini 1.5 Flash to create a voice assistant. This is perfect for workers who find typing difficult—they can just talk to the app to register or find a job.

Direct & Fast: There is no middleman. Once you see a worker on the map, you can tap a button to call them directly and get the job done.

Why this is better:
Fairness: Every worker gets a chance to be seen, even if they don't have a big social network.

Speed: You find help in seconds, not days.

Low Data: Because we use Leaflet.js, the app is very light and works well even on slow internet.
